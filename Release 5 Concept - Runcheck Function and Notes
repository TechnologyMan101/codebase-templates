This is a bash function meant to be added to the end of the function cluster in the Release 4 codebase. This is because Release 5 builds directly on top of Release 4. 

To use this function after it has been added, add "runcheck" before any command in the script that you want to be error-checked. It is NOT recommended to use this to error-check a function. It should only be used on individual commands. 

runcheck () {
	IFS=$' \t\n'
	command="$*"
	retval=1
	attempt=1
	until [[ $retval -eq 0 ]] || [[ $attempt -gt 5 ]]; do
		(
			set +e
			$command
		)
		retval=$?
		attempt=$(( $attempt + 1 ))
		if [[ $retval -ne 0 ]]; then
			clear
			tput setaf 9
			echo "Oops! Something went wrong! Retrying in 3 seconds..."
			tput sgr0
			sleep 3
			clear
		fi
	done
	if [[ $retval -ne 0 ]] && [[ $attempt -gt 5 ]]; then
		clear
		tput setaf 9
		echo "Oops! A fatal error has occurred and the program cannot continue. Returning to the main menu in 10 seconds..."
		tput setaf 3
		echo "Please try again later or if the problem persists, create an issue on GitHub."
		tput sgr0
		sleep 10
		clear
		mainmenu
	fi
	IFS=""
}
